# PartyPlayer (Beta)

PartyPlayer is a program made for parties. As a party host, you really don't want people asking you for songs, and taking your valuable drinking time, and as a guest you feel as if you annoyed the host by asking for songs every minute. This program is supposed to fix that, making everyone's lives easier and making parties more enojyable.

## How does it solve my problems?

Using the mobile client (current available for Android), you can request songs from your phone, view the queue, and if elevation is granted you can also control the playback (play, pause, seek, etc.).

## Usage

You can find downloads [here](#download)

### Setting up the server
Download & install PartyPlayer on your PC. To add the songs go to the Library and click 'Add' under Directories, and select the music directory you want to add. Set the server host & port in the Settings page, enable the server, and you're ready to go!

### Connecting with the client
To connect with the client you have to first of all connect to the same network (if the port is not forwarded, I'd recommend doing this locally though). If the server is local, the application will find the server automatically, otherwise you can manually enter the IP address and port.
